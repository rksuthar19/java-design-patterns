prototpye-Think about cloning, and spring prototype bean.
singleton-Either Eagerly initialize which will guarantees thread (static Obje o=new Obj()) or check if null and then set it in synchronize block and make it sure in default constructor it's not set to null to avoide creation from reflection. 
builder-creating an object in certain way that won't break funcationality, forcing to construct object in particular way.
